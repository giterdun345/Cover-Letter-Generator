# Cover Letter Generator
 Initial project files for a project using GPT-2 to generate text for a cover letter. I have attempted to automate the whole process for applying to jobs and have started with the cover letter generation. The cover letter results are coherent and follow the proper structure of a cover letter. I would like to take key points and desired attributes/characteristics from the job description that would influence the generation of the cover letter and make it more relevant and related to the job that is being applied for. Embeddings need to be modified; the methods for creating an accurate cover letter from the job description is similar to conversational AI in that there are multiple inputs to influence output. I will soon apply these strategies seen in conversational ai such as hugging face's approach. This approach can be found here: https://github.com/huggingface/transfer-learning-conv-ai. More improvements to come...
